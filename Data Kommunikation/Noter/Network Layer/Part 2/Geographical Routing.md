To further reduce the size of the routing tables, we extend this hierarchical routing to include geographical routing.

We must divide the entire address space into a few large blocks. We assign a block to America, a block to Europe, a block to Asia, a block to Africa, and so on.

> In this way, routers outside e.g., Europe only have one entry to all addresses in Europe.
