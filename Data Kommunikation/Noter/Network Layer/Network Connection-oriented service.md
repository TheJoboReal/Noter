If this method is used, then there is a relationship between all packets belonging to the same message. Before all packets in a message can be sent, a virtual connection should be set up to define the path for the datagrams. After connection setup, the datagrams can all follow the same path. A flow label, a virtual circuit identifier, is used to define the path.

The datagram is packaged with the flow label. And the router uses this info for forwarding.

#### Setup Phase
Field, Outgoing Label, is reserved in all routers' forwarding tables with Request packet.

The setup phase
1. A sends a request packet to R1
2. R1 receives the package. It can see that the connection must go from A to B through its own port 3. R1 creates a line in its forwarding table, but can only fill in 3 of the 4 fields:
* Incoming port = 1
* Incoming label = 14 (R1 chooses it by itself)
* Outgoing port = 3 (a ”knowledge” that R1 has based on destination B)
* Outgoing label = ? (just as R1 itself has chosen its label 14, so R3 will do so too, but R1 does not know it yet)
3. A request packet is sent from R1 to R3 which also reserves a line in its table,
fills it in and sends a request packet on to R4 etc. …
4. B receives the Request packet from R4, if it is ready to receive data from A,
then it sends an Ack packet (here with a label = 77) back to R4

R4 can now fill in its missing field in its forward table and send an Ack packet to R3 which can then fill in its missing field etc…
