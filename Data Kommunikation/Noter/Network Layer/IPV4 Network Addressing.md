The first address in the network (block) is called network address, which is particularly important because it is used in routing a packet to its destination network.
Let us assume that the Internet consists of *m* networks and a router with *m* interfaces (ports).
When a packet arrives at the router from any source host, the router needs to know which network the packet should be sent to: from which interface the packet should be sent out.

Once the network address is found, the forwarding table is consulted to find the interface number, from which the packet should be sent out.

#### Subnetting
More levels of hierarchy can be created using subnetting. An organization (or an ISP) that has been assigned a large block may want to divide the block into different subnetworks or subnets.
* The outside world still view the organization as a single network, but internally there are several different subnets.
* All data is sent to a router connected to the rest of the Internet.
* The router also forward data to the relevant subnets.

>The network block has one mask, and each subnet inside also has their own mask.

##### Subnetting Design
It is important that subnets are designed with care so that it is possible for a router to route packets to the relevant subnets.
Designing subnets If an organization has been assigned *N* addresses (the prefix length is n) the block is divided into subnets, the assigned number of addresses in each subnetwork is $N_{sub}$. Then the following procedure should be followed:
* The number of addresses in each subnet must follow n-th power of 2 (1, 2, 4, â€¦)
* The prefix length in each subnet is found as $n_{sub}=32-\log_{2}(N_{sub})$.
* The starting address of a subnet must be divisible by the number of addresses in the subnet

#### Address Aggregation
One of the advantages of the [[IPV4 Addressing#CIDR Example|CIDR]]  strategy is address aggregation. When blocks of addresses are combined to create a larger block, routing can be done based on the prefix of the larger block.
All packets for the large block is sent to a router connected to the smaller blocks.
This router (here ISP) then forward the packets to the right subnets.

#### Special Addresses
Before we end the topic of addresses in IPv4, we just need to mention some special addresses:

* This-host address
* Limited broadcast address
* Loop-back address
* Private address (NAT)
* Multicast address

This-host address: 0.0.0.0/32 this address is used when a host needs to send an IP datagram but does not know its own IP address to use as the source address.

Limited-broadcast adressen: 255.255.255.255/32 this address is used when a router or host needs to send a datagram to all devices in a network.
Note that such a datagram can NOT leave the network!
Routers in the network block further transmission out of the network (hence the word Limited)
