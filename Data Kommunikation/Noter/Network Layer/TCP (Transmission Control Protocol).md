1. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):
    
    - TCP is a connection-oriented and reliable protocol.
    - It establishes a connection before data transmission and ensures that data packets are delivered in order and without errors.
    - It is slower than UDP due to the overhead of managing connections and error correction.
    - TCP is commonly used for applications where data accuracy and completeness are essential, such as web browsing, email, and file transfers.
