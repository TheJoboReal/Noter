1. UDP (User Datagram Protocol):
    
    * UDP is a connectionless and lightweight protocol.
    * It does not establish a direct connection before sending data and does not guarantee the delivery or order of data packets.
    * It is faster and more efficient for real-time applications where some packet loss is acceptable, such as video streaming and online gaming.
    * UDP is often used when speed is more critical than data integrity.
