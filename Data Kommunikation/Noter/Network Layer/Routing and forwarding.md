It is the task of the Network layer to find the best route through the physical networks.

* Routing is applying strategies and running some routing protocols to create the decision-making tables (forwarding or routing tables) for each router.
* Forwarding is the action each router takes when a packet arrives at one of the router's ports and must be forwarded via another port according to the tables.
