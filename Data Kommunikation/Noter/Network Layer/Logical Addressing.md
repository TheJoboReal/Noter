In order to deliver packets from one place in the world to another, we need a global addressing system.
When we refer to the [[TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)|TCP]]/IP protocol suite, this is called IP addressing.
IP address is the address of the connection, not the host.
If the host is moved to another network, then the IP address is probably different.
