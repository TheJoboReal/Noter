Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) has divided port addresses into 3 ranges:
* Well-known ports: these are numbers in the range 0 – 1,023 and are assigned and controlled by ICANN.
* Registered ports: these are numbers in the range 1,024 – 49,151 and are not assigned or controlled by ICANN. They can be only registered with ICANN to avoid duplication.
* Dynamic ports: these are numbers in the range 49,152 - 65,535 and are neither registered nor controlled. They can be assigned to any process, and these are the temporary ports.
