According to this method, a station must make a reservation before data can be transmitted. The time is divided into intervals. In each interval, a reservation frame is sent before data frames are sent.

• If there are N stations in the system, then there are also N mini-slots in the reservation frame.

• Each mini-slot belongs to a specific station.

• When a station wants to send, it makes a reservation in its own mini-slot.

• The stations that have reserved transmission time can transmit their data frames after reservation frame.
