When nodes are connected in a common link, also called a multipoint
or broadcast link, then we need to have a protocol that can handle and coordinate access to the link.
The problem is handled by the protocols similar to the rules of speaking in an assembly:

• The right to speak is maintained.
• It is ensured that two people do not speak at the same time.
• It is ensured that they do not interrupt each other.
• It is ensured that the conversation does not develop into a
monologue (i.e., only one gets speaking time)
• And so on
