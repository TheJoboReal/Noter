In the Data Link layer, we pack the bit stream into what we call Frames, so
that the individual frames can be distinguished from each other.
The division of frames can take place in:
	• Fixed sizes (e.g., ATM Wide Area Network).
	• Variable sizes (most of LAN Networks)
We will concentrate on the variable-size framing, which is prevalent in local-
area networks.
Historically, there are two variable-size framing methods here:
	• Character-oriented
	• Bit-oriented
But common to both methods is that there must be a start- and end-flag
