**An FSM is a machine with a finite number of states.** The machine is always in one of the
states until an event occurs. Each event is associated with two reactions: defining the list
(possibly empty) of actions to be performed and determining the next state (which can be
the same as the current state). One of the states must be defined as the initial state, the
state in which the machine starts when it turns on.
