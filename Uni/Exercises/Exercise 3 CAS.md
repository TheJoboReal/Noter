#### Exercise Description
![[_CAS-2025-Lecture3-exercises.pdf]]


#### Exercise Answer
Bellow we insert a sinus wave at the same frequency as the resonans, we get the following. It can be seen that at the resonance frequency, the signal starts to swing and increase in amplitude.

The following is our PID controller with a step response input. We can see that it stabilises around ~116, which is the same as our DC-gain.
