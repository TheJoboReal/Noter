#### Exercise Description
![[_CAS-2025-Lecture7-exercises.pdf]]


#### Exercise Answer

#### opg 1.1
It can be seen that the system stabilises around the average of the initial condition. so if init is $[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]$ the point of stabilisation is $5.5$:

#### opg 1.2

When calculating the eigenvalues, we get:
-3.9021  
-3.6180  
-3.1756  
-2.6180  
-2.0000  
-1.3820  
-0.8244  
-0.3820  
-0.0979  
-0.0000

We see that one pole is placed in $\approx 0$, meaning that the system is not stable, and that the system will not stabilise around $0$, but instead around the average of the initial conditions.
