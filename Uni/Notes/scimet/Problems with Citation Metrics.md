## Summary

Citation metrics provide quantitative proxies for scientific impact but suffer from structural and methodological limitations.

- Google usually produces much more optimistic results than JCR
## Field Dependence
- Citation practices vary widely across disciplines
- Raw comparisons across fields are misleading

## Time Dependence
- Older publications accumulate more citations
- Early-career researchers are systematically disadvantaged

## Incentive Distortion
- Encourages quantity over quality
- Promotes strategic self-citation and citation cartels

## Misuse of Journal Metrics
- Journal-level metrics (e.g. impact factor) are often misapplied to individual articles or researchers

## Conceptual Limitation
- Citations measure attention, not correctness or scientific value

## Related Concepts
- [[Citation Count]]
- [[H-index]]
- [[Impact Factor]]
- [[Eigenfactor]]
- [[Article Influence Score]]
