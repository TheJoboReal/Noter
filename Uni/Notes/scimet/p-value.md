# `=this.file.name`

**`=this.file.name`** refers to:

> the probability of observing data at least as extreme as the observed result, assuming the null hypothesis is true.
^def

> The _p_-value is used in the context of null hypothesis testing in order to quantify the statistical significance of a result, the result being the observed value of the chosen statistic T. The lower the _p_-value is, the lower the probability of getting that result if the null hypothesis were true. A result is said to be _statistically significant_ if it allows us to reject the null hypothesis. All other things being equal, smaller _p_-values are taken as stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.

> Loosely speaking, rejection of the null hypothesis implies that there is sufficient evidence against it.

**Context / Notes (optional):**
- Smaller values indicate stronger evidence against the null hypothesis
- Common significance threshold: p < 0.05
- Does *not* represent the probability that the null hypothesis is true
- Does *not* measure effect size or practical importance
