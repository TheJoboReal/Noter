# `=this.file.name`

**`=this.file.name`** refers to:

> The causal distinction in an experiment where the independent variable is manipulated and the dependent variable is measured as the outcome.
^def

Independent variables are what we expect will influence dependent variables. **A dependent variable is what happens as a result of the independent variable**.

**Context / Notes (optional):**
- Clarifies cause–effect structure in experiments
- If you **choose it** → [[Independent Variable|independent]]
- If you **measure it** → [[Dependent Variable|dependent]]

**Example Set 1 - Robotics**
- Independent Variable: control algorithm type
- Dependent Variable: task completion time

**Example Set 2 - Human–Robot Interaction**
- Independent Variable: robot gaze behavior
- Dependent Variable: perceived trust score

**Example Set 3 — Engineering Materials**
- Independent Variable: temperature
- Dependent Variable: material deformation

**Related:**
- [[Independent Variable]]
- [[Dependent Variable]]
