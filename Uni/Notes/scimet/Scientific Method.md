## Summary

The [[#^def|Scientific Method]] provides a structured framework for empirical inquiry, ensuring that knowledge claims are grounded in evidence, logical reasoning, and reproducible procedures.

**`=this.file.name`** refers to:

> a systematic, evidence-based process for acquiring knowledge through problem formulation, hypothesis testing, experimentation, and analysis.
^def

## Core Components
1. Identify a problem
2. Review existing knowledge (literature)
3. Formulate a [[Hypothesis#^def|hypothesis]] 
4. [[04-Permanent-Notes/Experimental Design|Design an experiment]]
5. Collect data
6. Analyze data | Statistical analysis
7. Draw conclusions
8. Communicate results

## Variables
Experiments typically distinguish between:
- [[Independent Variable#^def]]
- [[Dependent Variable#^def]]

Correct identification of these variables is essential for valid experimental conclusions.

## Data and Measurement
The choice of measurement scale constrains permissible analyses:
- [[Nominal Scale#^def]]
- [[Ordinal Scale#^def]]

Sampling quality is assessed via [[Representative Sample#^def]] considerations.

## Quality Criteria
- Transparency
- [[Reproducibility#^def]]
- Control of confounding variables
- Appropriate statistical reasoning
