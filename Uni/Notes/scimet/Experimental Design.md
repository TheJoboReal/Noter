## Summary
Experimental design specifies how an experiment is structured to test a hypothesis while controlling bias, variability, and confounding influences.

## Core Elements
An experiment is defined by:
- [[Independent Variable#^def]]
- [[Dependent Variable#^def]]
- Controlled conditions
- Sampling strategy

## Control and Bias Reduction
Experimental validity relies on:
- [[Control Variable#^def]]
- [[Randomization#^def]]
- [[Replication#^def]]

Each addresses a different source of error:
- control → confounding
- randomization → systematic bias
- replication → random variability

## Study Structure
Common design distinctions:
- Between-subjects vs within-subjects
- Single-factor vs multi-factor designs
- Observational vs experimental studies

## Validity Considerations
- Internal validity: causal correctness
- External validity: generalizability
- Measurement validity: correct operationalization

- [[Independent vs Dependent Variable]]
- [[Representative Sample]]
- [[Reproducibility]]
