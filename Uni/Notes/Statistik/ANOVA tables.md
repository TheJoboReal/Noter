ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a statistical method used to test if there are significant differences between the means of three or more groups. It helps determine whether any of the differences observed are statistically significant or if they might have occurred by chance.

**Uses of ANOVA:**

* Comparing the means of multiple groups (e.g., testing different treatment effects in an experiment).
* Analyzing factors that might influence outcomes, like comparing sales across different regions or testing different teaching methods.
* Identifying whether variations in data are due to group differences or random fluctuations.

There are different types of ANOVA (e.g., one-way, two-way), depending on the number of independent variables being analyzed.
