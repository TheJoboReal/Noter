#### TLDR
> **Normal distribution** is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean, depicting that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean.

#### Definition
Normal Distribution is the most common or normal form of distribution of Random Variables, hence the name "normal distribution." It is also called the **Gaussian Distribution** in Statistics or Probability. We use this distribution to represent a large number of random variables. It serves as a foundation for statistics and probability theory.

It also describes many natural phenomena, forms the basis of the [Central Limit Theorem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maths/central-limit-theorem/), and supports numerous statistical methods.

#### Normal Distribution Formula
$$
f(x, \mu, \sigma)=\frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{ 2\pi }}e^{\frac{-(x-\mu)^ 2}{2\sigma^ 2} }
$$
 where,
 - $x$ is [Random Variable](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/random-variable/)
 - $\mu$ is [Mean](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maths/what-is-mean/)
 - $\sigma$ is [Standard Deviation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maths/standard-deviation-formula/)
