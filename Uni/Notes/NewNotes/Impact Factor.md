#### Definition
* Measures the impact of a scientific journal by how much it is cited:
* $\text{2018 IF} = \frac{C}{I}$

* $C$: for all papers published the last two years (2016-2017), this is the total number of times all these papers were cited in papers from 2018
* $I$: the total number of citable items published by that journal in 2016-2017 
* Citable items: articles, reviews, proceedings, notes
