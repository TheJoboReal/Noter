>[!TLDR] Embodied AI is interacting with the environment.

#### Definition
Intelligence arises from the interaction between an agent’s brain, body, and its environment.

**The 3 steps to exploit biological principles in embodied AI:**
* Understanding biological systems (i.e., the mechanisms that bring about intelligent behaviour in humans or animals).
* Abstracting general principles of intelligent behaviour (in the form of specific algorithms or entire control architectures for robots).
* Applying these principles to the design of useful artifacts (e.g. software, robots etc.).

#### Embodied Cognition
Cognition is shaped by the state and capabilities of the organism.

The agent's beyond-the-brain body plays a significant causal role, or a physically constitutive role, in that
agent's cognitive processing.

#### Embodiment
* Embodiment focusses on interaction between “physical processes” and “information processes”.
* If a system is embodied, it is subject to the laws of physics.

Embodied approach follows a synthetic methodology of “understanding by building”, so focusing on the coupling and interaction between the brain, the body and the environment and suggests that:
* intelligence arises from this interaction
* brain processes can only be understood by considering this interaction

**How is embodiment useful?**
* Tasks can become much easier if embodiment is taken into account.
* Soft deformable tissue of fingertips makes grasping easier by reducing control requirements.

* If material properties are exploited, rapid movements can be achieved very easily even if the neural system is too slow to accurately control all the movement
* When your foot hits the ground, the elastic stretching and recoil of the ankle is taken over by the springy material of the muscle-tendon system and need not be controlled by the neural system

#### Exam Practice
Copy that to ChatGPT
You are going to act as a **curious peer master’s student in robotics** who wants to understand
**embodied AI**.
- Ask me questions about embodied AI as if you don’t know the concept.
- I will try to explain it to you.
- If my explanation is inaccurate, unclear, or incomplete, ask follow-up questions until you fully
understand.
- The conversation should only finish when you are able to clearly state what embodied AI is, including:
1. A definition in your own words.
2. How it differs from traditional AI.
3. At least one concrete example in robotics.
