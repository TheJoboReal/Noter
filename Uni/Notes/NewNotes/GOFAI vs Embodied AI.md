#### Abstract
GOFAI works by set instructions while embodied AI is all about interacting with the environment.

#### GOFAI
A good example of GOFAI is a CNC machine: It works entirely based on a set of given instructions and does not make any changes based on sensor input. A UR5 robot is also GOFAI as it also works strictly with a set of given instructions. These two robots have i common that they do not interact with the environment.

#### [[Uni/Notes/NewNotes/Embodied AI|Embodied AI]]
A good example of embodied AI is a romba. The only predefined sets of instructions for the romba is that it has to clean a room and probably a cleaning algorithm. The romba works by interacting with the environment using its LIDAR sensor and the front bumber. This allows the romba to interact with the environment and make a cleaning plan according to its interaction.
