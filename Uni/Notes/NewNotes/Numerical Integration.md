#### Definition[[Linux Querks]]
Compute $I=\int_{a}^b f(x) \, dx$
We should assume that $f(x)$ is expensive to evaluate, e.g. $f(x)$ may be the result of physical simulation of some physical system with input $x$.


#### Example

* Optimize robot trajectory so that the paint coverage thickness is close to the specified value everywhere 
* Paint is coming from nozzle (wet paint) 
*  Model the paint flux from the nozzle 
* Compute the resulting paint coverage thickness â€¢ Requires CAD model of the object to be painted
