* Want on board processing.
* Low Payload weight.
* Low precision.
	* Difficult as a drone is under actuated, meaning it has to tilt and has very little torque when yawing.
* Limited Battery
	* The optimal battery to vehicle ratio should be that 2/3 of the weight is the battery. 
* No ground fixture.
	* With a fixed manipulator you can apply a lot of force to an object.
* Teleoperation.
