The transport layer ensures that data is delivered SAFELY from one process (running program) on one computer (host) to another process (running program) on another computer (host).(by safe flow and error control) 

The Data Link layer is responsible for node-to-node communication (Frames are sent between neighboring nodes on a LAN) The Network layer is responsible for host‐to‐host communication (Datagrams are sent between hosts on the Internet.) The Transport layer is responsible for process‐to‐process communication.
