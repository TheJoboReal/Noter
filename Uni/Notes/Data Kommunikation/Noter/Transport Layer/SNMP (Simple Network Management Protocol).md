SNMP, or Simple Network Management Protocol, is a widely used network management protocol for monitoring and managing network devices and their performance. It allows network administrators to collect information and control devices like routers, switches, and servers. SNMP operates on the client-server model and uses a set of standard Management Information Bases (MIBs) to organize and retrieve data from devices. It consists of SNMP managers (typically software applications) that request and receive information from SNMP agents running on network devices. SNMP is an essential tool for monitoring and troubleshooting network infrastructure.
