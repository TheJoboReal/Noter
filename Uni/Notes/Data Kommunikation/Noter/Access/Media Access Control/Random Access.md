Random Access means:
• that no nodes are more important than others,
• that no nodes are assigned control over others,
• that no nodes allow or forbid others to send,
• that all nodes send whenever they want, provided that they follow
some predefined procedure, which includes testing the state of the
medium (busy/idle).

***

Since all nodes can send whenever they want, access conflict can occur, also called collision.
The involved frames will either be destroyed or modified.
To avoid this or solve the problem when it happens, all nodes follow
procedures that answer the following questions:

• When can a station access the medium?
• What can a station do if the medium is busy?
• How can a station determine a successful or faulty transmission?
• What can a station do if there is an access conflict?
