* One problem of the distribution of addresses through ISPs is that the ISP may not be able to grant the increasing demand when a business grows and needs more addresses because the addresses before and after the range may have been already allocated to other networks.
* However, only few addresses are needed for universal communication while many private block addresses can be used for internal communication.
* A technology that can provide the mapping between the private and universal addresses is Network Address Translation (NAT).

NAT can only be done via a NAT-capable router that runs NAT software.

* In all outgoing packets, the source address is replaced with the global address of the NAT router.
* In all incoming packets, the destination address is changed from the NAT router's global address to appropriate private address.

Replacing the source address in the outgoing packets is straightforward.
But how can the NAT router know the destination address of a packet coming from the Internet?
* This problem is solved with a translation table, internally in the NAT router.

>The use of only one global address by the NAT router allows only one private-network host to access a given external host.

***
**A pool of IP addresses:** Since a NAT router only has one global address, only one host
from the private network can access an external host.

To remove this restriction, the NAT router can use a pool of global addresses e.g., 4
global addresses: 200.24.5.8; 200.24.5.9; 200.24.5.10; 200.24.5.11

Now up to 4 hosts from the private network can communicate with the same external
host.

**Drawback:** No private-network host can access two external server programs on the
same host (e.g., http and FTP).


***
**Both IP address and port number:** in order to allow a many-to-many mapping relationship between hosts of a private network and external server programs, more information can be provided in the translation table.
Example: two hosts with the addresses 172.18.3.1 and 172.18.3.2 (from the private network) want to access a HTTP server on an external host with the address 25.8.3.2.

>Note that when a response from HTTP comes back, it is the combination of the source address 25.8.3.2 and the destination port number 1400 or 1401 that defines the host on the private network. 
>
>Also note that to make this work, the private port numbers must be unique.
