The main reason for migration from IPv4 to IPv6 is the address depletion of IPv4.

Abbreviated notation:

A method of shortening a IPv6 address by eliminating 0s, for example:
* 0074 is written as 74
* 000F is written as F
* 0000 is written as 0
* If multiple sections are 0000, then they can be replaced by a double colon ::
>Note that only the leading 0s can be removed, not the trailing 0s.
