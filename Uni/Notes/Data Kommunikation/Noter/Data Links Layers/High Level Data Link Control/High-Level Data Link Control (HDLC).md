High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) is a bit-oriented protocol. It can
communicate via both Point-to-Point and Multi-point links. It
implements the Stop-and-Wait protocol and contains ARQ.

Although this protocol is more a theoretical issue than practical, most
of the concept defined in this protocol is the basis for other practical
protocols such as PPP or the Ethernet protocol.

This protocol contains two transfer modes:
• Normal Response Mode (NRM)
• Asynchronous Balanced Mode (ABM)
