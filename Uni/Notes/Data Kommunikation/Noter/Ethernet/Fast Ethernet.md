Fast Ethernet was designed to compete with other high-speed LAN protocols.
IEEE created Fast Ethernet as standard 802.3u.
Fast Ethernet is backward compatible with Standard Ethernet, but the speed is 10 times higher with a data rate of 100 Mbps.
The following goals for Fast Ethernet can be summarized:
1. Upgrade the speed to 100 Mbps.
2. Make it compatible with Standard Ethernet.
3. Keep the same 48-bit MAC address.
4. Keep the same Frame format.
5. Maintain the same minimum and maximum lengths for frames.

#### Autonegotiation
A new feature is added and called Autonegotiation (automatic negotiation)
The purpose is as follows:
* Allow incompatible devices to connect to each other. E.g., 10Mbps device can communicate with 100Mbps device.
* Allow one device to have multiple capabilities.
* Allow a station to check the capabilities of a hub.
