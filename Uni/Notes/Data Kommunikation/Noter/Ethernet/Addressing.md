Standard Ethernet: Addressing

Each station on an Ethernet network (such as a PC, workstation, or
printer) has its own Network Interface Card (NIC). The NIC fits inside the station and provides the station with a link-layer address. The Ethernet address is 6 bytes (48 bits), normally written in hexadecimal notation, with a colon between the bytes.
