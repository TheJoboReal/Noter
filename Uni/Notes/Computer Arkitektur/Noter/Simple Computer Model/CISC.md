CISC, or Complex Instruction Set Computer, is a computer architecture design that emphasizes the use of a large and diverse set of complex instructions. In CISC architecture, each instruction can perform multiple low-level operations, allowing for more versatile and powerful instruction execution. This contrasts with RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer), which uses a smaller and simpler set of instructions but aims for faster execution by completing instructions in a single clock cycle. CISC architectures, like x86, are known for their flexibility but can be more complex and challenging to optimize for modern computing.
