The algorithm maintains a set of visited vertices and a set of unvisited vertices. It starts at the source vertex and iteratively selects the unvisited vertex with the smallest tentative distance from the source. It then visits the neighbors of this vertex and updates their tentative distances if a shorter path is found. This process continues until the destination vertex is reached, or all reachable vertices have been visited.

#### The Algorithm
1. Mark the source node with a current distance of 0 and the rest with infinity.
2. Set the non-visited node with the smallest current distance as the current node.
3. For each neighbor, N of the current node adds the current distance of the adjacent node with the weight of the edge connecting 0->1. If it is smaller than the current distance of Node, set it as the new current distance of N.
4. Mark the current node 1 as visited.
5. Go to step 2 if there are any nodes are unvisited.
