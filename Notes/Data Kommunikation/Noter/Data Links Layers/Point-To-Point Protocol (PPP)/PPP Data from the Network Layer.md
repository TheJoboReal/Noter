PPP: Data from the Network layer
When the setup of the connection to the Network layer is completed by one of the selected NCP protocols, then data packets can be exchanged from the network layer.
Here again, there are different protocol field values for different network layers.
If the PPP carries data from the IP network protocol, then the value in this field is 0x0021 (note that the 3 rightmost digits are the same as for IPCP, i.e., 0x8021)
