The virtual memory viewed by the programmer is contiguous, separate and larger than the physical memory.
***
Virtual memory is a technique that allows the execution of processes that are not completely in memory; this allows programs to be larger than the actual physical memory.
Virtual memory separates the logical memory from the physical memory, as perceived by developers, which allows a allows a larger virtual memory to be provided for programmers when only a smaller
physical memory is actually available.
Another benefit is that virtual memory allows files and memory to be shared by two or more processes through page sharing.
