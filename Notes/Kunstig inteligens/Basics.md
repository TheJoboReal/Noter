#### Enviroments
* Accessible/inaccessible
	* Does an agent have access to the complete state of the environment?
* Deterministic/non-deterministic (stochastic)
	* Will the same action always produce the same result?
* Episodic/sequential (non-episodic)
	* Is the agent’s performance the result of a series of independent, one-shot actions (episodic environment) or does an action has consequences for future (sequential)
* Static/dynamic
	* Does the environment change independent of the agent’s actions?
* Discrete/continuous
	* Is the state space of the environment discrete or continuous?

#### Main Topics of AI
Artificial intelligence can be considered under a
number of headings:
* Search (includes game playing).
* Knowledge representation.
* Planning.
* Learning.
* Natural language processing.
* Expert systems.
* Robotics.

#### Supervised and Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised is fx you give the agent a lot of data, and tell it to find patterns in it
