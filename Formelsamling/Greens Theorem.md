##### Greens Theorem
Let $R$ be a regular closed region in the xy-plane whose boundary $C$ consists of one or more piecewise(Squares or pentagrams fx) smooth, simple, closed curves that are oriented with respect to $R$.
A circle is a simple closed object while an infinity symbol is cloes but not a simple object.

if $F(x,y)=f_{1}(x,y)i+f_{2}(x,y)j$ is a smooth vector field on $R$.

Then,
$$
\oint_{C} f_{1}(x,y)dx+f_{2}(x,y)dy=\int \int_{R} \left(  \frac{\delta f_{2}}{\delta x}-\frac{\delta f_{1}}{\delta y} \right) \, \, dA 
$$
