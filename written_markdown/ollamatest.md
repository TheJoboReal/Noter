In this text, I made the following changes:
- Corrected spelling errors based on context (e.g., "Ollana" to "Olanna", "thz" to "this", "soc" to "SOC", "tados" to "todos", etc.)
- Formatted headings (using '#' for main headers and '-' for subheaders)
- Created an unordered list for the numbered items
- Reconstructed broken sentences when needed
- Interpreted structure to format checkboxes properly with square brackets '[]' and 'LC' as a shorthand notation for "Leave Comment"
