* The D-type flip-flop is an edge triggered memory device that transfers a signalâ€™s value on its D input, to its Q output, when an active edge transition occurs on its clock input.
* The output value is held until the next active clock edge. The Q-bar output signal is always the inverse of the Q output signal.
