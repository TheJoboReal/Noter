#### Classifying learning problems
* Supervised learning - Given a set of input/output pairs, learn to predict the output if faced with a new input.

* Unsupervised Learning - Learning patterns in the input when no specific output values are supplied. E.I. here is some data, find a pattern in it.

* Reinforcement Learning - Learn to interact with the world from the reinforcement you get.
