To reason about the behavior of a system, we setup models that describe the input-output behavior of the system.

The models are given by
	I Differential equations
	I Algebraic relations


#### Example
![[Pasted image 20240202083014.png]]
	I The force F is considered to be the input
	I The mass velocity is considered to be the output of the system
The system is of second order, since the dynamics of the system depends on both position and velocity

The system model is given by Newton’s second law
$$
m \frac{d^2p}{d}=-k\cdot-b\cdot \frac{dp}{d}+f
$$
where F is the input (corresponds to u in the drawing).
The output y of the system is given by the relation
$$
y=p'
$$
It is seen that the system model comprises
	I a 2nd order differential equation (given by Newton’s second law) and 	I an algebraic relation (output relation)
