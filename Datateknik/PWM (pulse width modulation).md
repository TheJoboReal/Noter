#### Definition
PWM signals are basically used to mimic analog signals using digital systems. By adjusting the duty cycle, you can effectively control the average voltage or current delivered to a load. This allows for control of a motor or LED for example
***
PWM stands for Pulse Width Modulation. It's a technique used in electronic systems to control the average power delivered to a load by switching power on and off at a fixed frequency but varying the width of the on-time, or duty cycle, of the signal.

In simpler terms, PWM signals are essentially digital signals where the ratio of time the signal is ON to the time it is OFF (the duty cycle) can be varied. This modulation technique is widely used in applications such as controlling the speed of motors, regulating the brightness of LEDs, generating analog signals, and more.
***
PWM signals are particularly useful because they allow for the efficient control of power delivery without dissipating much heat, which makes them ideal for applications where power efficiency is crucial.
