Very simple guideline:  
• Circle all the rectangular blocks of 1’s in the map, using the fewest possible  
number of circles  
• Each circle should be as large as possible  
• Read off the implicants that were circled  
• More formally:  
• A Boolean equation is minimized when it is written as a sum of the fewest  
number of prime implicants  
• Each circle on the K-map represents an implicant  
• The largest possible circles are prime implicants
