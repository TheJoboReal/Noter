**Logical address:** An address generated by the CPU.

**Physical address:** An address loaded into the memory-address register of the memory.
The set of all logical addresses generated by a program is a logical address space. The set of all physical addresses corresponding to these logical addresses is a physical address space.

Binding addresses at either compile or load time generates identical logical and physical
addresses. However, the execution-time address-binding scheme results in different logical and physical addresses.
The run-time mapping from logical to physical addresses is done by a hardware device called the memory-management unit (MMU).

#### Example
memory-management unit (MMU) scheme is a generalization of the base-register scheme described before. The value in the relocation register (base register) is added to every address generated by a user process at the time the address is sent to memory.

The user program never accesses the real physical addresses, only generate logical addresses, and thinks that the process runs in memory locations from 0 to max. However, these logical addresses must be mapped to physical addresses ranging from R+0 to R+max.

The memory-mapping hardware separates the logical address space from the physical one.
