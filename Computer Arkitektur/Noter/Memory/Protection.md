One additional bit is generally attached to each entry in the page table: a validâ€“invalid bit. When this bit is set to valid, the associated page is in the process's logical address
space and is thus a legal (or valid) page. When the bit is set to invalid, the page is not in the process's logical address space.

#### Hierarchical Page Table structure

E.g., a 32-bit address space and a page size of 4 Kb gives over 1 million entries.
Here the solution can be several levels in a page table, so the whole table can be divided into small pieces.

The advantage: does not have to have such a large amount of page table related data in memory.
The cost for this is longer access times (which can be partially remedied with [[Paging#TLB|TLB]])

only one page table in the system, one entry for each page of phsical memory.
Reduces administration but loses the ability to share pages.
