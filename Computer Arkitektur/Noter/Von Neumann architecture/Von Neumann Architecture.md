The Von Neumann architecture is composed of three independent components (or subsystems): a Central Processing Unit (CPU), Memory and an Input / Output device (I / O interface).

1. The CPU is the “brain” of the computer system and contains three main components: Control unit, one or more Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs) and a varying number of Registers.
2. The memory is used to store program instructions and data. Two commonly used types of memory are Random Access Memory (RAM) and Read-Only Memory (ROM).
3. The I / O interface enables the computer's memory to exchange information with the outside world.
