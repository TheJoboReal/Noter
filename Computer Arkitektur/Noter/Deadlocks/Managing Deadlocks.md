* Ignore the problem and pretend that it never occurred…
e.g.: Unix, Linux, Windows and more… It is then up to kernel and
application developers to write programs that handle deadlocks
(typically using approaches in the second solution)

* Use a protocol to make sure deadlock never occurs…
i.e., deadlock prevention and avoidance

* Allow deadlock to occur and then detect it and recover
afterwards… i.e., deadlock detection and recovery
e.g.: databases
